TI  - Functional magnetic resonance imaging, deep learning, and Alzheimer's disease: A 
      systematic review.
PG  - 5-18

AB  - Alzheimer's disease (AD) is currently diagnosed using a mixture of psychological 
      tests and clinical observations. However, these diagnoses are not perfect, and 
      additional diagnostic tools (e.g., MRI) can help improve our understanding of AD 
      as well as our ability to detect the disease. Accordingly, a large amount of 
      research has been invested into innovative diagnostic methods for AD. Functional 
      MRI (fMRI) is a form of neuroimaging technology that has been used to diagnose 
      AD; however, fMRI is incredibly noisy, complex, and thus lacks clinical use. 
      Nonetheless, recent innovations in deep learning technology could enable the 
      simplified and streamlined analysis of fMRI. Deep learning is a form of 
      artificial intelligence that uses computer algorithms based on human neural 
      networks to solve complex problems. For example, in fMRI research, deep learning 
      models can automatically denoise images and classify AD by detecting patterns in 
      participants' brain scans. In this systematic review, we investigate how fMRI 
      (specifically resting-state fMRI) and deep learning methods are used to diagnose 
      AD. In turn, we outline the common deep neural network, preprocessing, and 
      classification methods used in the literature. We also discuss the accuracy, 
      strengths, limitations, and future direction of fMRI deep learning methods. In 
      turn, we aim to summarize the current field for new researchers, suggest specific 
      areas for future research, and highlight the potential of fMRI to aid AD 
      diagnoses.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a complex and severe neurodegenerative 
      disease that still lacks effective methods of diagnosis. The current diagnostic 
      methods of AD rely on cognitive tests, imaging techniques and cerebrospinal fluid 
      (CSF) levels of amyloid-β1-42 (Aβ42), total tau protein and hyperphosphorylated 
      tau (p-tau). However, the available methods are expensive and relatively 
      invasive. Artificial intelligence techniques like machine learning tools have 
      being increasingly used in precision diagnosis. METHODS: We conducted a 
      meta-analysis to investigate the machine learning and novel biomarkers for the 
      diagnosis of AD. METHODS: We searched PubMed, the Cochrane Central Register of 
      Controlled Trials, and the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews for reviews 
      and trials that investigated the machine learning and novel biomarkers in 
      diagnosis of AD. RESULTS: In additional to Aβ and tau-related biomarkers, 
      biomarkers according to other mechanisms of AD pathology have been investigated. 
      Neuronal injury biomarker includes neurofiliament light (NFL). Biomarkers about 
      synaptic dysfunction and/or loss includes neurogranin, BACE1, synaptotagmin, 
      SNAP-25, GAP-43, synaptophysin. Biomarkers about neuroinflammation includes 
      sTREM2, and YKL-40. Besides, d-glutamate is one of coagonists at the NMDARs. 
      Several machine learning algorithms including support vector machine, logistic 
      regression, random forest, and naïve Bayes) to build an optimal predictive model 
      to distinguish patients with AD from healthy controls. CONCLUSIONS: Our results 
      revealed machine learning with novel biomarkers and multiple variables may 
      increase the sensitivity and specificity in diagnosis of AD. Rapid and 
      cost-effective HPLC for biomarkers and machine learning algorithms may assist 
      physicians in diagnosing AD in outpatient clinics.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Multiple structural brain changes in Alzheimer's disease (AD) and 
      mild cognitive impairment (MCI) have been revealed on magnetic resonance imaging 
      (MRI). There is a fast-growing effort in applying artificial intelligence (AI) to 
      analyze these data. Here, we review and evaluate the AI studies in brain MRI 
      analysis with synthesis. METHODS: A systematic review of the literature, spanning 
      the years from 2009 to 2020, was completed using the PubMed database. AI studies 
      using MRI imaging to investigate normal aging, mild cognitive impairment, and 
      AD-dementia were retrieved for review. Bias assessment was completed using the 
      PROBAST criteria. RESULTS: 97 relevant studies were included in the review. The 
      studies were typically focused on the classification of AD, MCI, and normal aging 
      (71% of the reported studies) and the prediction of MCI conversion to AD (25%). 
      The best performance was achieved by using the deep learning-based convolution 
      neural network algorithms (weighted average accuracy 89%), in contrast to 76-86% 
      using Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machines, and other AI methods. 
      DISCUSSION: The synthesized evidence is paramount to developing sophisticated AI 
      approaches to reliably capture and quantify multiple subtle MRI changes in the 
      whole brain that exemplify the complexity and heterogeneity of AD and brain 
      aging.

LID - 10.1002/alz.13412 [doi]
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Artificial intelligence (AI) and neuroimaging offer new 
      opportunities for diagnosis and prognosis of dementia. METHODS: We systematically 
      reviewed studies reporting AI for neuroimaging in diagnosis and/or prognosis of 
      cognitive neurodegenerative diseases. RESULTS: A total of 255 studies were 
      identified. Most studies relied on the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging 
      Initiative dataset. Algorithmic classifiers were the most commonly used AI method 
      (48%) and discriminative models performed best for differentiating Alzheimer's 
      disease from controls. The accuracy of algorithms varied with the patient cohort, 
      imaging modalities, and stratifiers used. Few studies performed validation in an 
      independent cohort. DISCUSSION: The literature has several methodological 
      limitations including lack of sufficient algorithm development descriptions and 
      standard definitions. We make recommendations to improve model validation 
      including addressing key clinical questions, providing sufficient description of 
      AI methods and validating findings in independent datasets. Collaborative 
      approaches between experts in AI and medicine will help achieve the promising 
      potential of AI tools in practice. HIGHLIGHTS: There has been a rapid expansion 
      in the use of machine learning for diagnosis and prognosis in neurodegenerative 
      disease Most studies (71%) relied on the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging 
      Initiative (ADNI) dataset with no other individual dataset used more than five 
      times There has been a recent rise in the use of more complex discriminative 
      models (e.g., neural networks) that performed better than other classifiers for 
      classification of AD vs healthy controls We make recommendations to address 
      methodological considerations, addressing key clinical questions, and validation 
      We also make recommendations for the field more broadly to standardize outcome 
      measures, address gaps in the literature, and monitor sources of bias.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Alzheimer's Disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disease 
      that threatens the health of the elderly. Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) is 
      considered to be the prodromal stage of AD. To date, AD or MCI diagnosis is 
      established after irreversible brain structure alterations. Therefore, the 
      development of new biomarkers is crucial to the early detection and treatment of 
      this disease. At present, there exist some research studies showing that 
      radiomics analysis can be a good diagnosis and classification method in AD and 
      MCI. OBJECTIVE: An extensive review of the literature was carried out to explore 
      the application of radiomics analysis in the diagnosis and classification among 
      AD patients, MCI patients, and Normal Controls (NCs). RESULTS: Thirty completed 
      MRI radiomics studies were finally selected for inclusion. The process of 
      radiomics analysis usually includes the acquisition of image data, Region of 
      Interest (ROI) segmentation, feature extracting, feature selection, and 
      classification or prediction. From those radiomics methods, texture analysis 
      occupied a large part. In addition, the extracted features include histogram, 
      shapebased features, texture-based features, wavelet features, Gray Level 
      Co-Occurrence Matrix (GLCM), and Run-Length Matrix (RLM). CONCLUSION: Although 
      radiomics analysis is already applied to AD and MCI diagnosis and classification, 
      there still is a long way to go from these computer-aided diagnostic methods to 
      the clinical application.

AB  - Neurodegenerative disorders represent a significant and growing global health 
      challenge, necessitating continuous advancements in diagnostic tools for accurate 
      and early detection. This work explores the recent progress in Magnetic Resonance 
      Imaging (MRI) techniques and their application in the realm of neurodegenerative 
      disorders. The introductory section provides a comprehensive overview of the 
      study's background, significance, and objectives. Recognizing the current 
      challenges associated with conventional MRI, the manuscript delves into advanced 
      imaging techniques such as high-resolution structural imaging (HR-MRI), 
      functional MRI (fMRI), diffusion tensor imaging (DTI), and positron emission 
      tomography-MRI (PET-MRI) fusion. Each technique is critically examined regarding 
      its potential to address theranostic limitations and contribute to a more nuanced 
      understanding of the underlying pathology. A substantial portion of the work is 
      dedicated to exploring the applications of advanced MRI in specific 
      neurodegenerative disorders, including Parkinson's disease, Alzheimer's disease, 
      Huntington's disease, and Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS). In addressing the 
      future landscape, the manuscript examines technological advances, including the 
      integration of machine learning and artificial intelligence in neuroimaging. The 
      conclusion summarizes key findings, outlines implications for future research, 
      and underscores the importance of these advancements in reshaping our 
      understanding and approach to neurodegenerative disorders.

AB  - In the last decade, different research groups in the academic setting have 
      developed induced pluripotent stem cell-based protocols to generate 
      three-dimensional, multicellular, neural organoids. Their use to model brain 
      biology, early neural development, and human diseases has provided new insights 
      into the pathophysiology of neuropsychiatric and neurological disorders, 
      including microcephaly, autism, Parkinson's disease, and Alzheimer's disease. 
      However, the adoption of organoid technology for large-scale drug screening in 
      the industry has been hampered by challenges with reproducibility, scalability, 
      and translatability to human disease. Potential technical solutions to expand 
      their use in drug discovery pipelines include Clustered Regularly Interspaced 
      Short Palindromic Repeats (CRISPR) to create isogenic models, single-cell RNA 
      sequencing to characterize the model at a cellular level, and machine learning to 
      analyze complex data sets. In addition, high-content imaging, automated liquid 
      handling, and standardized assays represent other valuable tools toward this 
      goal. Though several open issues still hamper the full implementation of the 
      organoid technology outside academia, rapid progress in this field will help to 
      prompt its translation toward large-scale drug screening for neurological 
      disorders.

AB  - We envisage the development of new Brain Health Services to achieve primary and 
      secondary dementia prevention. These services will complement existing memory 
      clinics by targeting cognitively unimpaired individuals, where the focus is on 
      risk profiling and personalized risk reduction interventions rather than 
      diagnosing and treating late-stage disease. In this article, we review key 
      potentially modifiable risk factors and genetic risk factors and discuss 
      assessment of risk factors as well as additional fluid and imaging biomarkers 
      that may enhance risk profiling. We then outline multidomain measures and risk 
      profiling and provide practical guidelines for Brain Health Services, with 
      consideration of outstanding uncertainties and challenges. Users of Brain Health 
      Services should undergo risk profiling tailored to their age, level of risk, and 
      availability of local resources. Initial risk assessment should incorporate a 
      multidomain risk profiling measure. For users aged 39-64, we recommend the 
      Cardiovascular Risk Factors, Aging, and Incidence of Dementia (CAIDE) Dementia 
      Risk Score, whereas for users aged 65 and older, we recommend the Brief Dementia 
      Screening Indicator (BDSI) and the Australian National University Alzheimer's 
      Disease Risk Index (ANU-ADRI). The initial assessment should also include 
      potentially modifiable risk factors including sociodemographic, lifestyle, and 
      health factors. If resources allow, apolipoprotein E ɛ4 status testing and 
      structural magnetic resonance imaging should be conducted. If this initial 
      assessment indicates a low dementia risk, then low intensity interventions can be 
      implemented. If the user has a high dementia risk, additional investigations 
      should be considered if local resources allow. Common variant polygenic risk of 
      late-onset AD can be tested in middle-aged or older adults. Rare variants should 
      only be investigated in users with a family history of early-onset dementia in a 
      first degree relative. Advanced imaging with 18-fluorodeoxyglucose positron 
      emission tomography (FDG-PET) or amyloid PET may be informative in high risk 
      users to clarify the nature and burden of their underlying pathologies. 
      Cerebrospinal fluid biomarkers are not recommended for this setting, and 
      blood-based biomarkers need further validation before clinical use. As new 
      technologies become available, advances in artificial intelligence are likely to 
      improve our ability to combine diverse data to further enhance risk profiling. 
      Ultimately, Brain Health Services have the potential to reduce the future burden 
      of dementia through risk profiling, risk communication, personalized risk 
      reduction, and cognitive enhancement interventions.

AB  - Alzheimer's disease (AD) presents a significant challenge in neurodegenerative 
      research and clinical practice due to its complex etiology and progressive 
      nature. The integration of artificial intelligence (AI) into the diagnosis, 
      treatment, and prognostic modelling of AD holds promising potential to transform 
      the landscape of dementia care. This review explores recent advancements in AI 
      applications across various stages of AD management. In early diagnosis, 
      AI-enhanced neuroimaging techniques, including MRI, PET, and CT scans, enable 
      precise detection of AD biomarkers. Machine learning models analyze these images 
      to identify patterns indicative of early cognitive decline. Additionally, AI 
      algorithms are employed to detect genetic and proteomic biomarkers, facilitating 
      early intervention. Cognitive and behavioral assessments have also benefited from 
      AI, with tools that enhance the accuracy of neuropsychological tests and analyze 
      speech and language patterns for early signs of dementia. Personalized treatment 
      strategies have been revolutionized by AI-driven approaches. In drug discovery, 
      virtual screening and drug repurposing, guided by predictive modelling, 
      accelerate the identification of effective treatments. AI also aids in tailoring 
      therapeutic interventions by predicting individual responses to treatments and 
      monitoring patient progress, allowing for dynamic adjustment of care plans. 
      Prognostic modelling, another critical area, utilizes AI to predict disease 
      progression through longitudinal data analysis and risk prediction models. The 
      integration of multi-modal data, combining clinical, genetic, and imaging 
      information, enhances the accuracy of these predictions. Deep learning techniques 
      are particularly effective in fusing diverse data types to uncover new insights 
      into disease mechanisms and progression. Despite these advancements, challenges 
      remain, including ethical considerations, data privacy, and the need for seamless 
      integration of AI tools into clinical workflows. This review underscores the 
      transformative potential of AI in AD management while highlighting areas for 
      future research and development. By leveraging AI, the healthcare community can 
      improve early diagnosis, personalize treatments, and predict disease outcomes 
      more accurately, ultimately enhancing the quality of life for individuals with 
      AD.

TI  - Diagnostic power of resting-state fMRI for detection of network connectivity in 
      Alzheimer's disease and mild cognitive impairment: A systematic review.
PG  - 2941-2968
LID - 10.1002/hbm.25369 [doi]
AB  - Resting-state fMRI (rs-fMRI) detects functional connectivity (FC) abnormalities 
      that occur in the brains of patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD) and mild 
      cognitive impairment (MCI). FC of the default mode network (DMN) is commonly 
      impaired in AD and MCI. We conducted a systematic review aimed at determining the 
      diagnostic power of rs-fMRI to identify FC abnormalities in the DMN of patients 
      with AD or MCI compared with healthy controls (HCs) using machine learning (ML) 
      methods. Multimodal support vector machine (SVM) algorithm was the commonest form 
      of ML method utilized. Multiple kernel approach can be utilized to aid in the 
      classification by incorporating various discriminating features, such as FC 
      graphs based on "nodes" and "edges" together with structural MRI-based regional 
      cortical thickness and gray matter volume. Other multimodal features include 
      neuropsychiatric testing scores, DTI features, and regional cerebral blood flow. 
      Among AD patients, the posterior cingulate cortex (PCC)/Precuneus was noted to be 
      a highly affected hub of the DMN that demonstrated overall reduced FC. Whereas 
      reduced DMN FC between the PCC and anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) was observed 
      in MCI patients. Evidence indicates that the nodes of the DMN can offer moderate 
      to high diagnostic power to distinguish AD and MCI patients. Nevertheless, 
      various concerns over the homogeneity of data based on patient selection, scanner 
      effects, and the variable usage of classifiers and algorithms pose a challenge 
      for ML-based image interpretation of rs-fMRI datasets to become a mainstream 
      option for diagnosing AD and predicting the conversion of HC/MCI to AD.
